# email-signature

Simple email signature block in plain-Jane html, with a little shadow fakery using tables.

If you like it, feel free to use and abuse. If you hate it, that's cool too ðŸ™‚

**Update**
The first signature isn't email safe. It relies on border radius and other techniques that I'm now
discovering email clients don't support (wtf).
